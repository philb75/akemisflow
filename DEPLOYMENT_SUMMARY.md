# AkemisFlow Deployment Summary

## âœ… Deployment Configuration Complete

Your application is now configured to support both local development and production deployment.

### What Was Done

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Added `DIRECT_URL` support for Prisma (required by Supabase)
   - Created `.env.production` template with Supabase configuration
   - Updated `.env.local` to include `DIRECT_URL` for consistency
   - Created `.env.example` for team reference

2. **Database Configuration**
   - Updated `prisma/schema.prisma` to support connection pooling
   - Added `directUrl` for migrations (Supabase requirement)
   - Local Docker PostgreSQL continues to work unchanged

3. **Deployment Scripts**
   - `scripts/deploy-to-supabase.sh` - Deploy database schema to Supabase
   - `scripts/test-local-env.sh` - Verify local environment still works
   - Updated `vercel.json` with production settings

4. **Documentation**
   - `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Complete deployment instructions
   - Updated `README.md` with deployment reference
   - Created this summary document

### Local Development (No Changes Required)

Your local Docker environment continues to work exactly as before:
```bash
# Start Docker PostgreSQL
docker-compose up -d postgres

# Run the application
pnpm dev
```

### Production Deployment Steps

1. **Create Supabase Database**
   - Go to supabase.com and create a project
   - Get your database password from Settings > Database

2. **Configure Production Environment**
   ```bash
   # Copy template
   cp .env.production .env.production.local
   
   # Edit .env.production.local with your actual values
   # (This file is gitignored - safe for secrets)
   ```

3. **Deploy Database Schema**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy-to-supabase.sh
   ```

4. **Deploy to Vercel**
   ```bash
   # Commit your changes
   git add .
   git commit -m "Configure production deployment"
   git push origin master
   
   # Deploy with Vercel CLI
   vercel
   ```

5. **Set Vercel Environment Variables**
   In Vercel Dashboard > Settings > Environment Variables, add:
   - DATABASE_URL (Supabase pooled connection)
   - DIRECT_URL (Supabase direct connection)
   - NEXTAUTH_SECRET (generate with: openssl rand -base64 32)
   - NEXTAUTH_URL (https://your-app.vercel.app)
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
   - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY

### Important Notes

- **Local files remain unchanged** - Your Docker setup works as before
- **Sensitive data is protected** - All production configs are in gitignored files
- **Dual environment support** - Same codebase works locally and in production
- **File uploads** - Currently stored locally; consider Supabase Storage for production

### Next Steps

1. Get your Supabase credentials
2. Create `.env.production.local` with real values
3. Run deployment script
4. Deploy to Vercel
5. Create your first admin user
