# Production Database Connection Workaround

## Issue Summary
- ✅ Supabase JS client connects successfully
- ❌ Prisma fails to connect (both pooled and direct connections)
- This appears to be a Prisma-specific issue in the Vercel environment

## Immediate Workaround

Since the Supabase client works, I've created an alternative sync endpoint that bypasses Prisma:

### Use the Supabase-based Sync Endpoint
```
POST https://akemisflow-philippe-barthelemys-projects.vercel.app/api/suppliers/sync-airwallex-supabase
```

This endpoint:
- Uses Supabase JS client instead of Prisma
- Performs the same sync operations
- Works around the Prisma connection issue

## Test Endpoints Available

1. **Test all connection methods:**
   ```
   /api/test-all-connections
   ```

2. **Test connection string structure:**
   ```
   /api/test-connection-string
   ```

3. **Test Supabase client (working):**
   ```
   /api/test-supabase
   ```

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue appears to be:
1. Prisma client in Vercel cannot establish connection to Supabase
2. This affects both pooled (6543) and direct (5432) connections
3. Supabase JS client works fine, indicating the issue is Prisma-specific
4. Could be related to:
   - Prisma client generation in Vercel build
   - Network/SSL handling differences between Prisma and Supabase client
   - Vercel function runtime environment

## Long-term Solutions

1. **Option 1: Use Supabase Client Throughout**
   - Replace Prisma with Supabase client for all database operations
   - Pros: Works immediately, good TypeScript support
   - Cons: Need to rewrite queries

2. **Option 2: Debug Prisma Build Process**
   - Check Vercel build logs for Prisma generation issues
   - Try different Prisma versions
   - Add more verbose logging

3. **Option 3: Use Different Database Access Method**
   - Consider using Vercel Postgres
   - Or use a different ORM that works with Vercel

## Next Steps

1. Use the `/api/suppliers/sync-airwallex-supabase` endpoint for now
2. Monitor the test endpoints to see if the issue resolves
3. Contact Vercel support with the specific error details
4. Consider migrating to Supabase client if issue persists
