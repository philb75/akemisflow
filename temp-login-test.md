# Temporary Login Test

The database authentication is working perfectly:
- ✅ User exists: `philippe.barthelemy@akemis.com`
- ✅ Password hash verified: bcrypt $2b$12$ format
- ✅ Role: ADMINISTRATOR
- ✅ All fields present

## Issue Analysis
The problem is likely in the Prisma adapter mapping between database fields and the expected NextAuth structure.

## Quick Fix Options:

### Option 1: Try Alternative Email
Since we have 2 users in the database, try:
- Email: `philb75@gmail.com`  
- Password: `Philb123$`

### Option 2: Database Column Mapping Issue
The issue might be:
- Database has: `emailVerified` 
- Prisma expects: `email_verified`
- Or similar field mapping issues

### Option 3: Create Fresh User with Exact Field Names
Create a user that matches exactly what NextAuth/Prisma expects.

## Current Status
- Database: ✅ Working perfectly
- User Creation: ✅ Working perfectly  
- Password Hashing: ✅ Working perfectly
- Issue: 🔍 Prisma/NextAuth field mapping

## Recommendation
Try logging in with `philb75@gmail.com` first, then we'll fix the field mapping if needed.
