  "originalRequest": "Add a new Comments section above the Personal Information section in the contractor expanded view. The section should: 1. Have a header 'Comments' with the same styling as other sections (blue text, icon, border-bottom) 2. Display the existing comment field (which is currently shown without a section header) 3. The comment field should be in the left column only (AkemisFlow Contractor column) 4. The comment field should have no label (just the textarea/text) 5. Move this from its current position to be inside the new Comments section",
